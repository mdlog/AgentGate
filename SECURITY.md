The on-chain registry contract currently supported is the Casper Testnet

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please **do not open a public issue** for security problems.

Preferred: use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting —
[Report a vulnerability](https://github.com/mdlog/AgentGate/security/advisories/new).

Alternatively, email **adiadi2411@gmail.com** with:

- a description of the issue and its impact,
- reproduction steps or a proof of concept,
- any suggested fix, if you have one.

You can expect an acknowledgement within **72 hours** and a status update as
the fix progresses. Please give us a reasonable window to remediate before any
public disclosure.

## Scope notes

- The gateway only ever sees payment *proofs* (transaction hashes); it never
  holds user private keys. Signing keys for the demo deployment live outside
  the repository.
- Testnet CSPR has no monetary value, but vulnerabilities in the payment
  verification path (invoice nonce, transfer matching, attestation binding)
  are still treated as high severity.
