# AgentGate

**Stripe for AI agents on Casper.** Read the live on-chain service catalog with zero setup —
no config, no keys:

```bash
npx @mdlog/agentgate list
```

Wrap any HTTP API into a paid, on-chain-registered service in one command — the only thing
on the line besides the args is your funded wallet key:

```bash
npx @mdlog/agentgate wrap https://api.example.com/data --price 0.5 --name "My Data API" --pem ./key.pem
```

`wrap` registers on-chain (signed by `--pem`) and maps your upstream on the gateway by
signing an ownership challenge — no shared admin token. `--gateway` defaults to the hosted
gateway; pass it to target a local/self-hosted one.

Sellers put a **402 paywall** in front of their API and register it in an on-chain
registry. Buyer agents discover services from the registry, pay with a **native CSPR
transfer carrying the invoice nonce as `transfer_id`**, retry with the payment proof, and
get the data — while the gateway records an **on-chain attestation** that feeds each
service's trust score. No accounts, no API keys, no subscriptions: HTTP 402 + Casper.

```

## Quickstart (offline, 60 seconds)

Requires Node ≥ 22. No keys, no network, no chain access needed:

```bash
npm install
npm run demo     # full loop: register → 402 → pay → serve → attest → score, exits 0
```

The demo boots a mock chain + oracle + gateway in-process, wraps the oracle at
0.5 CSPR, runs the LLM buyer agent (deterministic MockLlm — no API key needed), and
prints the **payment deploy hash**, the **attestation tx hash**, and the final score.

### See it in the dashboard (one command)

```bash
npm run dev:seed          # boots devnet+oracle+middleware AND seeds one wrapped
                          # service + a real paid call, then STAYS UP
npm run dev:dashboard     # in a second terminal → open the URL it prints
```

> **`npm run demo` won't show in the dashboard** — it's a self-contained one-shot
> that boots its *own* in-memory chain, runs the loop, and exits, so its data is gone
> by the time you open a browser. Use `npm run dev:seed` (persistent + populated) to
> view it live. The dashboard polls the running stack every 5 s.

> **Port note:** the dashboard defaults to `http://localhost:3000`, but if 3000 is
> already taken Next.js silently moves to **3001** (or the next free port). Always
> open the URL printed in the `dev:dashboard` terminal, not a hard-coded 3000.

### Manual dev loop

```bash
npm run dev               # empty stack: devnet :4030 + oracle :4010 + middleware :4021
# paste the printed MOCK_BUYER_ACCOUNT / MOCK_SELLER_ACCOUNT export lines, then:
npm run agentgate -- wrap http://localhost:4010/feed --price 0.5 --name "RWA FX & Gold Oracle"
npm run agent -- --task "Get today's USD/IDR rate and gold price, summarize for a treasury report"
```

Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to let the buyer agent use Claude instead of the MockLlm.

## Mode matrix

`AGENTGATE_MODE=mock|live` (default `mock`) selects the chain backend behind the
`ChainClient` seam — everything above it is identical:

| | `mock` | `live` (Casper Testnet) |
|---|---|---|
| Chain | in-memory devnet (`@agentgate/devnet`) | casper-js-sdk v5 + CSPR.cloud REST |
| Signers | mock account strings | PEM keys |
| Payment verify | devnet transfer lookup | CSPR.cloud `GET /transfers?deploy_hash=` |
| Registry | devnet mirrors the Odra contract rules | deployed `AgentGateRegistry` contract |
| Guardrails | default admin token OK, SSRF guard off | default token refused, SSRF guard on |

All env vars are documented in [.env.example](.env.example). The **gateway and background
services** in live mode require `CSPR_CLOUD_API_KEY` and a non-default `AGENTGATE_ADMIN_TOKEN`
(enforced by config). The **CLI is looser**: `list`/`status` read the public node with no keys
at all; only `status` attestation history needs `CSPR_CLOUD_API_KEY`, and `wrap`'s gateway
mapping needs the gateway's admin token. Every value can also be passed as a flag
(`--mode`, `--node-url`, `--registry`, `--pem`, `--api-key`, `--admin-token`; flag > env > default).

Contract tests: `cd contracts/agentgate-registry && cargo odra test` (20 OdraVM tests).

## Deployed addresses (Casper Testnet)

**Live on Casper Testnet** (Casper 2.0, network `casper-test`). The full loop —
register → pay (native CSPR transfer, `transfer_id` = invoice nonce) → attest → score —
runs on-chain; the trust score reads `(1,1)` after the attestation below. Set
`REGISTRY_CONTRACT_PACKAGE_HASH` to the package hash for live mode.

| Artifact | Value |
|---|---|
| `AgentGateRegistry` package hash | `hash-10f92725551941ffe5be84cd340ce0f31f9f25d1f8ed959cc1a6c3383c3e27e9` |

## Going live

The registry is **deployed to Casper Testnet** (addresses above). The deploy runbook is in
[docs/DEPLOY.md](docs/DEPLOY.md), including the wasm toolchain requirement (**binaryen ≥ 123** +
`wasm-strip`; older binaryen leaves a bulk-memory `DataCount` section that makes stored
entry-point calls revert with *"Sections out of order"*) and the verify-against-deployed-contract notes.

Hosting the services is documented in [docs/HOSTING.md](docs/HOSTING.md): dashboard →
Vercel (root `vercel.json`), middleware + oracle → Railway (per-package Dockerfiles +
`railway.json`), plus a self-contained `docker-compose.hosting.yml` demo stack.

## Roadmap

Testnet Plan B (native transfer + `transfer_id`) → mainnet → x402 Facilitator (Plan A)
→ CSPR.cloud streaming → MCP server for agent frameworks.
