## What is AgentGate

AI agents can't pay for the APIs they use — no cards, no logins, no accounts. AgentGate is the payment layer that fixes this on Casper: a seller wraps an API in one command, a buyer agent discovers and pays it in one command, and every paid call leaves a verifiable on-chain receipt.

**Everything below is live on Casper Testnet and verifiable right now.**

- **One-command wrap** — any HTTP API becomes a paid, on-chain-registered service; the private upstream never touches the chain.
- **One-command buy** — discover from the on-chain registry, pay a machine-readable 402 invoice, get the data back.
- **On-chain multi-asset price list** — each service stores an `accepts[]` price list *in the contract* (registry v2): pay in **native CSPR**, or in **WCSPR through the official Casper x402 facilitator** — gas sponsored, no native-transfer floor, true sub-CSPR micropayments.
- **Native MCP tools** — one line of config and any MCP-capable agent (Claude Desktop, custom clients) gets discover / inspect / pay as native tools.
- **Payment-backed reputation** — each served call is attested on-chain, so trust scores are receipts of real value transfer, not marketing.
- **Zero-config reads** — `list` and `status` read the public node with no keys, no `.env`, no clone.

## Try it in 30 seconds

Zero setup, no keys — reads the live on-chain registry straight from the public node (Node ≥ 22):

```bash
npx @mdlog/agentgate@latest list          # the live on-chain service catalog
curl -sS https://gateway.mdloglabs.org/svc/2   # a real HTTP 402 invoice from the live gateway
```

<details>
<summary><b>For judges / reviewers — drive the live MCP server in one paste</b></summary>

<br>

The published CLI defaults to **live Casper Testnet** + the deployed registry, and the read tools use the public node RPC — no `.env`, no CSPR.cloud key, no clone. From any directory:

```bash
( printf '%s\n' \
  '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2025-06-18","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"judge","version":"0.0.0"}}}' \
  '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"notifications/initialized"}' \
  '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"agentgate_list_services","arguments":{}}}' ; \
  sleep 8 ) | npx -y @mdlog/agentgate@latest mcp 2>/dev/null \
  | jq -r 'select(.id==2) | .result.content[0].text | fromjson'
```

Cloned the repo? `scripts/mcp.sh` wraps the same handshake:

```bash
scripts/mcp.sh list
scripts/mcp.sh invoice 2     # a real HTTP 402 invoice; the nonce changes each call
```

Only `agentgate_buy` needs a funded buyer key — every read tool is zero-setup.

</details>

---

## The one-liners

**Sell** — wrap any HTTP API into a paid service. Registers on-chain (signed by `--pem`) and maps your upstream on the gateway via an owner-signed challenge (no shared admin token):

```bash
npx @mdlog/agentgate wrap https://api.example.com/data --price 2.5 --name "My Data API" --pem ./key.pem
```

**Buy** — pay one call to any listed service. The CLI pays the 402 invoice (native transfer, or an EIP-712 authorization on the facilitator rail) and prints the data — body to stdout, payment receipt to stderr:

```bash
npx @mdlog/agentgate buy 2 --pem ./buyer.pem --max 5
```

**Hand it to an agent** — one command exposes the whole loop to any MCP-capable client as native tools:

```bash
npx @mdlog/agentgate mcp          # a Model Context Protocol stdio server
```

Tools: `agentgate_list_services`, `agentgate_get_service`, `agentgate_get_invoice` (read-only, no key) and `agentgate_buy` (pays a 402 invoice from the buyer key, capped by `maxCspr`). Wire it into Claude Desktop's `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{ "mcpServers": { "agentgate": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "@mdlog/agentgate", "mcp"] } } }
```

---

## How it works

Sellers put a **402 paywall** in front of their API and register it in an on-chain registry with a per-asset **`accepts[]` price list**. Buyer agents discover services from the registry and pay on the rail the service advertises — a **native CSPR transfer carrying the invoice nonce as `transfer_id`**, or an **EIP-712 authorization settled by the official CSPR.cloud x402 facilitator** (gas sponsored). Either way the buyer retries with the payment proof, gets the data, and the gateway records an **on-chain attestation** that feeds each service's trust score. No accounts, no API keys, no subscriptions: HTTP 402 + Casper.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant Seller as Seller (CLI)
    participant Chain as Casper (registry)
    participant Gate as AgentGate gateway
    participant Agent as Buyer agent
    participant API as Upstream API

    Seller->>Chain: register service (accepts[] price list, payment target, attestor)
    Seller->>Gate: map upstream (owner-signed challenge → /services/:id/map)
    Agent->>Chain: discover catalog + trust scores
    Agent->>Gate: GET /svc/:id
    Gate-->>Agent: 402 PaymentRequiredResponse (x402Version, error, accepts[])
    Agent->>Chain: CSPR transfer (transfer_id = nonce)
    Agent->>Gate: GET /svc/:id + X-PAYMENT: <base64 proof>
    Gate->>Chain: verify transfer (target, amount, transfer_id, age)
    Gate->>API: proxy (nonce burned first — single use)
    API-->>Gate: data
    Gate-->>Agent: 200 data
    Gate--)Chain: attestation (success) → score → trust tier
```

The diagram shows the native rail. A service whose on-chain `accepts[]` includes a CEP-18 option (e.g. `0.1 WCSPR`) runs the **official x402 facilitator rail** instead: the 402 is an x402 v2 body derived from the contract, the buyer signs an EIP-712 authorization (`PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` header), and the CSPR.cloud facilitator verifies + settles on-chain with sponsored gas before the gateway proxies and attests.

## Quickstart (offline)

Requires Node ≥ 22. No keys, no network, no chain access needed:

```bash
npm install
npm run demo     # full loop: register → 402 → pay → serve → attest → score, exits 0
```

The demo boots a mock chain + oracle + gateway in-process, wraps the oracle at 0.5 CSPR, runs the LLM buyer agent (deterministic MockLlm — no API key needed), and prints the **payment deploy hash**, the **attestation tx hash**, and the final score.

### See it in the dashboard

```bash
npm run dev:seed          # boots devnet+oracle+middleware AND seeds one wrapped
                          # service + a real paid call, then STAYS UP
npm run dev:dashboard     # in a second terminal → open the URL it prints
```

### Manual dev loop

```bash
npm run dev               # empty stack: devnet :4030 + oracle :4010 + middleware :4021
# paste the printed MOCK_BUYER_ACCOUNT / MOCK_SELLER_ACCOUNT export lines, then:
npm run agentgate -- wrap http://localhost:4010/feed --price 0.5 --name "RWA FX & Gold Oracle"
npm run agent -- --task "Get today's USD/IDR rate and gold price, summarize for a treasury report"
npm run agentgate -- buy 1 --mode mock    # or skip the agent: pay once, print the data
```

Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to let the buyer agent use Claude instead of the MockLlm.

<details>
<summary><b>Port notes and gotchas</b></summary>

<br>

- **Demo ports:** the demo binds `:4030` (devnet), `:4010` (oracle) and `:4021` (gateway). If one is taken (`EADDRINUSE`), override: `DEVNET_PORT=14030 ORACLE_PORT=14010 MIDDLEWARE_PORT=14021 npm run demo`.
- **`npm run demo` won't show in the dashboard** — it boots its *own* in-memory chain, runs the loop, and exits, so its data is gone by the time you open a browser. Use `npm run dev:seed` (persistent + populated) to view it live. The dashboard polls the running stack every 5 s.
- **Dashboard port:** defaults to `http://localhost:3000`, but if 3000 is taken Next.js silently moves to **3001** (or the next free port). Always open the URL printed in the `dev:dashboard` terminal.

## Configuration and modes

`AGENTGATE_MODE=mock|live` (default `mock` for the repo stack; the published CLI defaults to `live`) selects the chain backend behind the `ChainClient` seam — everything above it is identical:

| | `mock` | `live` (Casper Testnet) |
|---|---|---|
| Chain | in-memory devnet (`@agentgate/devnet`) | casper-js-sdk v5 + CSPR.cloud REST |
| Signers | mock account strings | PEM keys |
| Payment verify | devnet transfer lookup | CSPR.cloud `GET /transfers?deploy_hash=` |
| Registry | devnet mirrors the Odra contract rules | deployed `AgentGateRegistry` contract |
| Guardrails | default admin token OK, SSRF guard off | default token refused, SSRF guard on |

All env vars are documented in [.env.example](.env.example). In **live mode** the gateway and background services require `CSPR_CLOUD_API_KEY` and a non-default `AGENTGATE_ADMIN_TOKEN` (enforced by config). The **CLI is looser**: `list`/`status` read the public node with no keys; only `status` attestation history needs `CSPR_CLOUD_API_KEY`. Live `wrap` needs **no** admin token — it maps the upstream by signing an ownership challenge with your `--pem` key (verified against the on-chain `owner`). Live `buy` needs only a funded buyer key (`--pem` or `BUYER_SIGNER_PEM_PATH`). Every value can also be passed as a flag (`--mode`, `--node-url`, `--registry`, `--pem`, `--api-key`, `--admin-token`; flag > env > default).

## Deployed addresses

**Live on Casper Testnet** (Casper 2.0, network `casper-test`) — **registry v2** with the on-chain multi-asset `accepts[]` price list (unlocked/upgradable package). The full loop — register (accepts[]) → pay (native CSPR transfer **or** WCSPR via the x402 facilitator) → attest → score — runs on-chain; every catalog service carries a genuine payment-backed attestation. Set `REGISTRY_CONTRACT_PACKAGE_HASH` to the package hash for live mode (the published CLI already defaults to it).

## Deployment and hosting

The registry is **deployed to Casper Testnet** (addresses above). **Currently hosted:** the live-mode gateway runs at **https://gateway.mdloglabs.org** and the dashboard at **https://agentgate.mdloglabs.org** (cloudflared tunnels → local PM2 services). The CLI is published to npm as [`@mdlog/agentgate`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mdlog/agentgate).

<details>
<summary><b>Deploy runbook and self-hosting</b></summary>

<br>

- **Contract deploy:** [docs/DEPLOY.md](docs/DEPLOY.md), including the wasm toolchain requirement (**binaryen ≥ 123** + `wasm-strip`; older binaryen leaves a bulk-memory `DataCount` section that makes stored entry-point calls revert with *"Sections out of order"*) and the verify-against-deployed-contract notes.
- **Hosting the services:** [docs/HOSTING.md](docs/HOSTING.md) — dashboard → Vercel (root `vercel.json`), middleware + oracle → Railway (per-package Dockerfiles + `railway.json`), plus a self-contained `docker-compose.hosting.yml` demo stack.
- **Gateway runbook:** `deploy/agentgate.ecosystem.config.cjs` in [docs/DEPLOY-GATEWAY.md](docs/DEPLOY-GATEWAY.md).

</details>

## Roadmap

**Shipped**

- Native CSPR rail — transfer with the invoice nonce bound as `transfer_id`
- Official x402 facilitator rail — WCSPR via CSPR.cloud, EIP-712, gas sponsored
- On-chain multi-asset `accepts[]` price list — registry v2 (unlocked/upgradable)
- MCP server for any agent framework — `npx @mdlog/agentgate mcp`
