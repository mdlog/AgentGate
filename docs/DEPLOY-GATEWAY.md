# Hosting the live AgentGate gateway

The CLI's live `wrap` defaults `--gateway` to `DEFAULT_GATEWAY_URL`
(`https://gateway.mdloglabs.org`, in `packages/shared/src/config.ts`). For the
one-line `npx @mdlog/agentgate wrap … --pem ./key.pem` to complete its upstream
mapping, a **live-mode middleware** must be reachable at that URL. Reads
(`list`/`status`) never touch the gateway, so they work regardless.

The gateway exposes an owner-signature self-service map endpoint
(`POST /services/:id/map`) — sellers authorize their mapping by signing an
ownership challenge with their wallet key, so **no shared admin token is handed
out**. The gateway still needs its own credentials for payment verification and
attestations.

## Required environment (live)

| Var | Why |
|---|---|
| `AGENTGATE_MODE=live` | Casper Testnet, SSRF guard on, fail-closed gate signer |
| `REGISTRY_CONTRACT_PACKAGE_HASH` | the deployed `hash-10f92725…` |
| `CSPR_CLOUD_API_KEY` | payment-transfer verification + attestation history |
| `GATE_SIGNER_PEM_PATH` | attestor key the gateway signs `record_attestation` with (funded) |
| `AGENTGATE_ADMIN_TOKEN` | a strong unique token (the shipped default is refused in live) — only guards the legacy `/admin/services`; self-service mapping does not use it |
| `TRUST_PROXY=1` | when behind exactly one platform proxy (Railway/Fly/Cloudflare), so rate-limit keys off the real client IP |

## Run it

The middleware ships a production Dockerfile (`packages/middleware/Dockerfile`).

```bash
docker build -f packages/middleware/Dockerfile -t agentgate-gateway .
docker run -d --name agentgate-gateway -p 4021:4021 \
  -e AGENTGATE_MODE=live \
  -e REGISTRY_CONTRACT_PACKAGE_HASH=hash-10f92725551941ffe5be84cd340ce0f31f9f25d1f8ed959cc1a6c3383c3e27e9 \
  -e CSPR_CLOUD_API_KEY="$CSPR_CLOUD_API_KEY" \
  -e AGENTGATE_ADMIN_TOKEN="$(openssl rand -hex 32)" \
  -e GATE_SIGNER_PEM_PATH=/keys/gate.pem \
  -e TRUST_PROXY=1 \
  -v /path/to/gate.pem:/keys/gate.pem:ro \
  -v agentgate-gateway-data:/app/packages/middleware/data \
  agentgate-gateway
```

Then put a TLS-terminating reverse proxy / tunnel in front and point the DNS for
`gateway.mdloglabs.org` at it. Health check: `GET /healthz` → `{ ok, network }`;
readiness (chain reachable): `GET /readyz`.

## Verify

```bash
# from a seller box, with a funded wallet key:
npx @mdlog/agentgate wrap https://api.example.com/gold --price 2.5 --name "My API" --pem ./key.pem
# → prints service id + public endpoint; the gateway logs `self_mapped`.
curl https://gateway.mdloglabs.org/svc/<id>        # → 402 payment challenge
```

If the gateway is unreachable when you `wrap`, the on-chain registration still
succeeds; the CLI prints a warning and the `/svc/<id>` endpoint 404s until the
mapping is (re-)done against a reachable gateway. Price services **≥ 2.5 CSPR**
for the native-transfer settlement rail.

## Notes / security

- Self-service mapping is authenticated by an on-chain-owner signature over a
  domain-separated challenge (`packages/shared/src/self-map.ts`), verified in
  `packages/middleware/src/app.ts` against `service.owner`. It is rate-limited,
  freshness-windowed (120 s), and monotonic-per-service against replay, and runs
  the same SSRF guard as the admin path.
- Keep `GATE_SIGNER_PEM_PATH` at mode `600`; the gateway warns if it is
  group/other-readable.
- Until this gateway is live, sellers can point `--gateway http://localhost:4021`
  at a locally-run middleware.

## This box's setup (cloudflared, matches the dashboard)

The repo already runs live via `scripts/live.ts` and this box already tunnels the
dashboard through cloudflared. Mirror that for the gateway.

**1. Run the gateway durably** (the dev process is session-scoped):

```bash
# quick: nohup npm run dev:live > gateway.log 2>&1 &
# durable (recommended): systemd --user unit shipped at deploy/agentgate-gateway.service
mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user
cp deploy/agentgate-gateway.service ~/.config/systemd/user/
loginctl enable-linger "$USER"
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now agentgate-gateway
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:4021/healthz    # {"ok":true,"network":"casper-test"}
```

**2. Set `TRUST_PROXY=1` in `.env`** (behind exactly one Cloudflare hop) so the
rate limiter keys off the real client IP, then restart the unit.

**3. Expose `gateway.mdloglabs.org` → `http://localhost:4021`** — pick one:

- **A — add a public hostname to the existing (dashboard) tunnel** (fastest, no
  second process): Cloudflare **Zero Trust → Networks → Tunnels →** the dashboard
  tunnel **→ Public Hostnames → Add** → subdomain `gateway`, domain
  `mdloglabs.org`, service `HTTP → localhost:4021`. Done — no CLI, no code change
  (`DEFAULT_GATEWAY_URL` already points here).

- **B — a dedicated locally-managed tunnel** (all CLI; uses the existing
  `~/.cloudflared/cert.pem`):

  ```bash
  cloudflared tunnel create agentgate-gateway
  cloudflared tunnel route dns agentgate-gateway gateway.mdloglabs.org
  # ~/.cloudflared/agentgate-gateway.yml:
  #   tunnel: <UUID printed by create>
  #   credentials-file: /home/mdlog/.cloudflared/<UUID>.json
  #   ingress:
  #     - hostname: gateway.mdloglabs.org
  #       service: http://localhost:4021
  #     - service: http_status:404
  cloudflared tunnel --config ~/.cloudflared/agentgate-gateway.yml run agentgate-gateway
  ```

**4. Verify publicly:**

```bash
curl -s https://gateway.mdloglabs.org/healthz     # {"ok":true,"network":"casper-test"}
# from any box with a funded wallet key:
npx @mdlog/agentgate wrap https://open.er-api.com/v6/latest/USD --price 2.5 --name "USD FX" --pem ./key.pem
curl -i https://gateway.mdloglabs.org/svc/<id>     # 402 challenge
```

Note: a public gateway spends the gate key's CSPR on an on-chain attestation per
**successful paid** call (buyers pay first, so it is self-limiting, not an open
drain). Keep the gate key funded.
