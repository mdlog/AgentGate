      <H2 id="what-is-agentgate">What AgentGate is</H2>
      <P>
        AgentGate is an <DocLink href="/docs/protocol">x402</DocLink>-style payment gateway — x402
        is the open convention for settling HTTP <M>402 Payment Required</M> challenges with
        on-chain payments — for machine-to-machine APIs. A seller puts any
        HTTP endpoint behind a <M>402 Payment Required</M> paywall and registers it in an on-chain
        Casper registry. A buying agent discovers that service, receives a machine-readable invoice,
        settles it on-chain, then retries with cryptographic proof of payment — and the gateway
        records an on-chain attestation that feeds the service&apos;s trust score. The whole loop is{' '}
        <M>register → 402 → pay → serve → attest → score</M>.
      </P>
      <P>
        Nothing about it is human-shaped. There is no signup form, no credit card, no KYC, and no API
        key to copy into a config file. The only credentials an agent needs are a Casper wallet and
        the ability to make an HTTP request — which is exactly what an autonomous agent already has.
      </P>

      <H3 id="mental-model">The mental model: HTTP 402 + Casper</H3>
      <P>
        HTTP reserved the status code <M>402 Payment Required</M> for decades without a standard way
        to use it. AgentGate gives it a concrete meaning. When an agent calls a paid endpoint with no
        proof, the gateway answers <M>402</M> with a <M>PaymentRequiredResponse</M> (x402 V1) — a
        JSON body with <M>x402Version:1</M>, a human-readable <M>error</M>, and an{' '}
        <M>accepts[]</M> array carrying <M>maxAmountRequired</M>, the <M>payTo</M> account, a
        single-use <M>extra.nonce</M>, and an <M>extra.expiresAtMs</M> timestamp. The agent reads
        the challenge, sends a{' '}
        <strong className="text-white">native CSPR transfer</strong> to <M>payTo</M> with{' '}
        <M>transfer_id = extra.nonce</M>, then retries the request with the{' '}
        <M>X-PAYMENT</M> proof header (base64-encoded <M>PaymentPayload</M>).
        The gateway verifies that transfer on-chain (target, amount, transfer id, and age), burns the
        nonce so it can never be reused, proxies to the seller&apos;s upstream API, and returns the
        response — then records a success attestation that lifts the service&apos;s trust tier.
      </P>
      <Callout tone="info" title="PAYMENT IS NATIVE CSPR">
        Settlement is a plain native CSPR transfer whose <M>transfer_id</M> equals the invoice nonce
        — the &ldquo;Plan B&rdquo; scheme. It is not a CEP-18 token transfer and it does not call any
        vault contract. The gateway never custodies funds; payment goes straight from the buyer to
        the seller&apos;s account. Note Casper enforces a network minimum of <M>2.5 CSPR</M> on
        native transfers; the gateway accepts any amount at or above the invoice price, but the
        bundled buyers pay exactly the invoice — so sellers should price at ≥ 2.5 CSPR.
      </Callout>

      <H2 id="when-to-use">When to use AgentGate</H2>
      <P>
        Reach for AgentGate when the consumer of an API is software that holds a wallet rather than a
        person with a card. Typical fits:
      </P>
      <DocTable
        head={['You want to…', 'AgentGate gives you']}
        rows={[
          [
            'Sell data or compute to autonomous agents',
            'A pay-per-call paywall in front of your existing API — no billing system to build.',
          ],
          [

        ]}
      />
      <P>
        It is a poor fit for human-facing checkout flows, subscriptions, or anything that needs
        chargebacks and refunds — those are the human-shaped patterns AgentGate deliberately
        replaces.
      </P>

      <H2 id="roles">The roles: seller, buyer, operator</H2>
      <P>
        Three actors meet at the gateway. Each has its own guide; this is the one-paragraph version
        of each.
      </P>
      <H3 id="role-seller">Seller — wraps an API</H3>
      <P>
        A seller owns an upstream HTTP API and wants to charge per call. Running{' '}
        <M>agentgate wrap</M> once registers the service on-chain (name, price in motes, payment
        target, attestor) and maps the private upstream URL on the gateway. After that, every call to
        the public <M>/svc/:id</M> endpoint is metered and paid. Full walkthrough in{' '}
        <DocLink href="/docs/sellers">Wrap an API</DocLink>.
      </P>
      <H3 id="role-buyer">Buyer — builds an agent that consumes a service</H3>
      <P>
        A buyer writes an agent that discovers services in the on-chain catalog, calls{' '}
        <M>/svc/:id</M>, handles the <M>402</M>, pays with a native CSPR transfer carrying the nonce,
        and retries with proof headers. You can do this with one command (<M>npx @mdlog/agentgate@latest
        buy</M>), the bundled LLM buyer agent, the client SDK&apos;s <M>fetchPaid</M> helper, or
        plain <M>curl</M>. See{' '}
        <DocLink href="/docs/buyers">Build an agent</DocLink>.
      </P>
      <H3 id="role-operator">Operator — runs the gateway</H3>
      <P>
        An operator runs the gateway (the 402 reverse proxy + admin API — the{' '}
        <M>@agentgate/middleware</M> package) and, in live mode, the chain plumbing. The operator
        sets the admin token, the SSRF policy on upstream URLs, and the chain backend, and points{' '}
        <M>REGISTRY_CONTRACT_PACKAGE_HASH</M> at a deployed <M>AgentGateRegistry</M> before going
        live — on Casper Testnet the contract is already deployed, so most operators just set the
        hash (deploying your own registry is covered in{' '}
        <DocLink href="/docs/contract">Smart contracts</DocLink>). See{' '}
        <DocLink href="/docs/deployment">Deploy to production</DocLink>.
      </P>

      <H2 id="modes">Mock vs live modes</H2>
      <P>
        A single environment variable — <M>AGENTGATE_MODE</M> — selects the chain backend behind the{' '}
        <M>ChainClient</M> seam. The stack (gateway, buyer agent, dashboard) defaults to <M>mock</M> via{' '}
        <M>loadConfig()</M>, while the published <M>npx</M> CLI defaults to <M>live</M>. Everything above
        the seam is identical, so you build and test offline and flip one flag to go on-chain.

        <M>REGISTRY_CONTRACT_PACKAGE_HASH</M> is unset (e.g. a fresh checkout with no .env), the

        when you run the gateway/stack yourself — the public gateway is already hosted at{' '}
        <M>https://gateway.mdloglabs.org</M>, and the published CLI defaults the registry hash and
        reads Casper Testnet with no keys.
