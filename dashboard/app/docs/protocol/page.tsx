        lede="AgentGate is an HTTP-402 payment gateway for AI agents following the x402 V1 wire format. A buyer agent discovers a service, receives a machine-readable 402 PaymentRequiredResponse (accepts[] with PaymentRequirements), pays with a native CSPR transfer whose transfer_id is the invoice nonce, then retries with the X-PAYMENT proof header. The gateway verifies the transfer on-chain, burns the nonce, proxies to the upstream API, and records an attestation that updates the service's trust score."

      <H2 id="flow">The flow at a glance</H2>
      <P>
        Every paid request follows the same single round trip: an unpaid <M>402</M> challenge,
        an on-chain payment, and a retry that carries proof of that payment. The gateway is a
        reverse proxy in front of the seller&apos;s real API; it never holds an API key and
        never reveals the upstream URL. The steps below are the exact sequence the gateway
        (<M>packages/middleware/src/app.ts</M>) and the buyer client
        (<M>packages/client/src/index.ts</M>) implement.

        When a retry arrives with proof headers, the gateway first checks the invoice behind the
        presented nonce (it must exist, match the requested <M>serviceId</M>, be unused, and be
        within <M>expiresAtMs</M>). It then verifies the transfer on-chain via{' '}

          chain.verifyTransfer({'{'} deployHash, expectedTarget, minAmountMotes, expectedTransferId,
          maxAgeMs {'}'})
        </M>{' '}

        A transfer that exists but has not finalized yet returns <M>settlement_pending</M> rather than a
        failure: the gateway keeps the same <M>accepts[]</M> alive (same nonce) and answers{' '}
        <M>402</M> with <M>error:"settlement_pending"</M> and a standard{' '}
        <M>Retry-After: 2</M> response header (seconds) so the buyer can re-present the identical
        proof shortly. Every other verification failure re-sends a fresh{' '}
        <M>PaymentRequiredResponse</M> (new nonce) so a client can re-pay.

        Once all four checks pass, the gateway burns the nonce{' '}

        store&apos;s <M>markUsed()</M> is a compare-and-set: exactly one concurrent request can
        consume a given nonce. Any other request presenting the same proof loses the race and
        receives a fresh <M>402 invoice_used</M>. A burned nonce stays burned even if the
        upstream call then fails — proof is consumed at most once, so a buyer is charged for at
        most one delivered call per invoice.

      <H2 id="attestation">Attestation and trust score</H2>
      <P>
        After the buyer&apos;s response is sent, the gateway records an on-chain attestation
        without blocking the request. The attestation input is{' '}
        <M>{'{ serviceId, paymentDeployHash, success }'}</M>, where{' '}
        <M>success</M> is true exactly when the upstream returned a 2xx (<M>isUpstreamSuccess</M>).
        If the attestation transaction fails, the gateway retries it once after a delay
        (default 5,000 ms); a final failure is only logged and never affects the buyer.
      </P>
      <P>
        Attestations accumulate into a per-service <M>ServiceScore</M> of two counters:{' '}
