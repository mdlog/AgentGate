A buyer agent discovers a service, receives a machine-readable 402 PaymentRequiredResponse (accepts[] with PaymentRequirements), pays with a native CSPR transfer whose transfer_id is the invoice nonce, then retries with the X-PAYMENT proof header.

      <H2 id="flow">The flow at a glance</H2>
      <P>
        Every paid request follows the same three-leg exchange: an unpaid <M>402</M> challenge,
        an on-chain payment, and a retry that carries proof of that payment. The gateway is a
        reverse proxy in front of the seller&apos;s real API; buyers never need an API key, and
        the upstream URL — which may embed the seller&apos;s own key — is stored only in the
        gateway&apos;s private map and never appears in any response. The steps below are the
        exact sequence the gateway
        (<M>packages/middleware/src/app.ts</M>) and the buyer client
        (<M>packages/client/src/index.ts</M>) implement.

        Payment is a <strong className="text-white">native CSPR transfer</strong>, not a token
        transfer. The buyer client calls <M>chain.transfer</M> with <M>accepts[].payTo</M>,{' '}
        <M>accepts[].maxAmountRequired</M>, and crucially{' '}
        <M>transferId = accepts[].extra.nonce</M> — the invoice nonce is reused verbatim as the
        Casper <M>transfer_id</M>, which binds the on-chain payment to this specific invoice.
        The transfer returns a deploy hash. After a settle delay the client base64-encodes a{' '}
        <M>PaymentPayload</M> and sends it as the <M>X-PAYMENT</M> request header.

        but the bundled buyers (<M>agentgate buy</M>, the SDK&apos;s <M>fetchPaid</M>, the LLM

        <M>success</M> is true exactly when the upstream returned a 2xx (<M>isUpstreamSuccess</M>).
        If the attestation transaction fails, the gateway retries with exponential backoff — base
        delay 5,000 ms doubling per attempt (5 s, 10 s, 20 s), up to 4 total attempts. A final
        failure is only logged and never affects the buyer; a call whose attempts all fail is
        under-counted, never over-counted.
